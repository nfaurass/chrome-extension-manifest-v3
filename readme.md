# Chrome Extension Manifest V3 Template

This is a simple starter template for building Chrome Extensions using Manifest V3, TypeScript, and Webpack.

---

## Features

- Uses Manifest V3 (latest Chrome extension format)
- Background script as service worker
- Content script injection
- Popup and Options pages with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript
- Webpack build system with TypeScript support
- Clean folder structure for easy development

---

## Folder Structure

- `src/` — Your TypeScript source files (background.ts, content.ts, popup.ts, options.ts)
- `html/` — HTML files for popup and options pages
- `public/` — Static assets like icons and images
- `dist/` — Compiled output files (generated by Webpack)
- `manifest.json` — Chrome extension manifest file

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Chrome extensions and TypeScript

### Install Dependencies

Run this command to install all needed packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the Extension

To build the extension files (compile TypeScript and bundle with Webpack), run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates the `dist/` folder with all JavaScript files and copies necessary assets.

### Watch for Changes (Development)

To automatically rebuild when you change source files, run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

or

```bash
npm run wc
```

(The `wc` command cleans the `dist/` folder and starts watch mode.)

---

## Loading the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the root folder of this project (make sure `manifest.json` is there)
5. The extension will load, and you can test it in the browser

---

## How It Works

- `manifest.json` tells Chrome how your extension works
- Background script runs as a service worker (in `dist/background.js`)
- Content scripts run on all pages and can inject CSS or JS (`dist/content.js`)
- Popup page shows UI when you click the extension icon (`html/popup.html` and `dist/popup.js`)
- Options page allows user settings (`html/options.html` and `dist/options.js`)
- Webpack bundles and compiles your TypeScript code into JavaScript

---

## Adding Your Code

- Edit the TypeScript files in `src/`
- Edit the HTML files in `html/`
- Edit styles in `html/css/style.css`
- Run `npm run build` or `npm run watch` to compile changes

---

## Cleaning Build Files

To remove the `dist/` folder, run:

```bash
npm run clean
```

or

```bash
npm run c
```
